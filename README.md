# A Google Drive CMS
## Python GAE Version (2.7)
This is a simple CMS proof-of-concept that uses Google Drive as the CMS part. This means that you don't need to bother with testing different WYSIWYG editors, dealing with authentication, passwords and sessions. The original version written in PHP is here: [https://github.com/ahmednuaman/gdrive-cms-php](https://github.com/ahmednuaman/gdrive-cms-php)

## How can I use it?
1. Clone the app: `git clone git@github.com:ahmednuaman/gdrive-cms-py-gae.git` or [download the zip](https://github.com/ahmednuaman/gdrive-cms-py-gae/archive/master.zip).
